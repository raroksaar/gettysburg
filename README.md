This uses the Leaflet JavaScript library with a static map image, the NPS park brochure for Gettysburg National Park. Pins on the map match the stops on the vehicle tour and have links to wikipedia articles. 

The park brochure was downloaded from the Library of Congress site: http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3822g.cw0352500
Basic_map.html was made using the Quickstart tutorial on the Leaflet site: https://leafletjs.com/ but centered on the Gettysburg site and with Google maps link attached to the popup that shows latitude-longitude values
